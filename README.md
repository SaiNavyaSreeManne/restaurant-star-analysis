# 🍽️ Restaurant Star Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This capstone project focuses on identifying **star restaurants** for a restaurant aggregator platform using data-driven analysis.  
The objective is to move beyond ratings alone and use multiple business metrics to improve restaurant recommendations and customer engagement.

---

## 🧠 Business Problem
A restaurant consolidator wanted to revamp its B2C platform using intelligent automation.  
To support this, the business needed:
- Better understanding of customer behavior
- Insights into restaurant performance
- A robust method to identify star restaurants

---

## 📊 Datasets Used
- **Restaurant Dataset**: 19 attributes including ratings, votes, cuisines, cost, delivery, and table booking
- **Country-Code Dataset**: Mapping country codes to country names

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy, sklearn)
- Tableau
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 🔍 Key Analysis Steps
1. Data inspection (structure, missing values, duplicates)
2. Data cleaning and preprocessing
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4. Cuisine, cost, rating, and delivery analysis
5. Identification of star restaurants using business-driven rules
6. Dashboard creation using Tableau

## 🧩 Skills Demonstrated
- Data cleaning & preprocessing  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Business insight generation  
- Data visualization  
- Dashboard design for stakeholders  

---

## ⭐ Star Restaurant Criteria
A restaurant is classified as a **star restaurant** if:
- Aggregate Rating ≥ 4.0  
- Votes ≥ 500  
- Online Delivery = Yes  

This multi-metric approach avoids bias from ratings alone.

---

## 📈 Key Insights
- Restaurants offering **online delivery** receive significantly higher votes  
- **Moderate pricing** performs better than very expensive restaurants  
- Higher **cuisine variety** is associated with better ratings  
- Table booking availability slightly improves ratings  

---

## 📊 Dashboard
An interactive Tableau dashboard was built to analyze:
- Country & city-wise restaurant distribution  
- Top cuisines  
- Ratings vs cost  
- Votes vs delivery option  
- KPIs such as average rating and total votes  

---

## 📁 Repository Structure
- `data/` – Raw and cleaned datasets  
- `notebooks/` – Python analysis notebooks  
- `dashboard/` – Tableau dashboard screenshots  
- `reports/` – Project documentation  

---

## 🎯 Outcome
This project demonstrates how **data cleaning, EDA, and visualization** can be combined to solve real-world business problems and support data-driven decision-making.
